# Data-Mining-Final-Project
NN with back propagation 

// NN for a clusting classification problem.  The programs input was EEG Data from a random patient.  It used brain wave data to predict if the patients eyes were open or closed.  We trined the Nural Network with an aut Colony to train the NN to predict and classify the data to get above 90% prediction rate on weather the patient eyes were open or closed during that data thread.
